# Project Directory

This repository contains all the projects I have worked on during my studies at the Université of Paris Cité.

## Projects of my third year

### Research project
This project is about the computation of the Mertens function.
All details are at [report_mertens.pdf](mertens/report_mertens.pdf)
The code and the slides are in the [mertens](mertens/) directory.

### Cryptography project
This project is a mix of different projects about cryptography.
The first part is about the implementation of the RSA algorithm and the Pollard Rho attack on it.
The second part is about the implementation of the El Gamal algorithm and the Baby-Step Giant-Step attack on it.
The third part is about the implementation of the Oblivious Transfer protocol using RSA.
The fourth part and the last part is about the implementation of two types of secure multi-party computation protocols.
All details are at [README.md](cr6-groupe4/README.md)

### Network project
This project is about the implementation of a multiplayer game of Bomberman.
All details are at [README.md](pr6-projet-bomberman/README.md)

### System project
This project is about the implementation of a bash-like shell.
All details are at [README.md](jsh_sy5/README.md)

### OcamL project
This project is two projects in one. The first part is about the implementation of a game Pandemic.
The second part is about the implementation of a bot for the game Quoridor made by another group.
All details for the Pandemic game are at [README.md](pandemicppo5/README.md)
The code for the Quoridor bot are at [bot_quoridor](bot_quoridor/bin/betterbot.ml)

## Projects of my second year

### Math project
This project is about the convolution matrix and their applications in steganography.
All details are at [Les_matrices_de_convolution.pdf](math_project/Les_matrices_de_convolution.pdf)

### Java and OOP project
This project is about the implementation of the game Peegle.
All details are at [README.txt](2022-os1-os1a-peegle/README.txt)

## Projects of my first year

### Math project
This project is about the Fibonacci sequence and the golden ratio.
All details are at [project_fibonacci_l1.pdf](math_project/project_fibonacci_l1.pdf)
